# PRM-in-XML examples

This repository holds some examples for the PRM-in-XML documentation system.
The examples are meant to be generated by the PRM-in-XML tool, which
converts the content to HTML files which can be read more easily.

The Releases on GitHub include the generated documentation.

## Building the examples

The PRM-in-XML tool is required to process these files. To build them, use a command like:

    riscos-prminxml prminxml/amplayer.xml
