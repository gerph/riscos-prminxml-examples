# PRM-in-XML examples

This repository holds some examples for the PRM-in-XML documentation system.
The examples are meant to be generated by the PRM-in-XML tool, which
converts the content to HTML files which can be read more easily.

The Releases on GitHub include the generated documentation.

## Building the examples with the tool

To directly generate the documentation, the PRM-in-XML tool is required to process these files.
To build them, use a command like:

    riscos-prminxml prminxml/amplayer.xml

## Building the examples with docker

Building the documentation can be performed on most modern POSIX systems with Docker.

With Docker:

    docker run -it --rm -v$PWD:/work -w /work ubuntu:18.04 ./build.sh

This will install all the necessary components and perform the build.
The build will produce results in the `output` directory, as HTML.

For PDF use, you should follow the [PrinceXML licensing](https://www.princexml.com/purchase/license_faq/) terms. For most use, you should be able to use the non-commercial license.
This can be indicated by setting the environment variable `PRINCEXML_I_HAVE_A_LICENSE`, thus:

    docker run -it --rm -v$PWD:/work -e PRINCEXML_I_HAVE_A_LICENSE=1 -w /work ubuntu:18.04 ./build.sh
